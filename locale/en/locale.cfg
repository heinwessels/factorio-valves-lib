factoriopedia-bad-connections=\n\n[font=default-bold]Limitation when connected to pumps:[/font]\nA valve's output cannot be connected to a pump's input. Due to a game engine limitation the pump will bypass the valve. You can check for bad connections at any point using the command [color=0.5,0.8,0.94]/valves-find-bad-connections[/color].
warn-command-help=Find and print all instances of valves with their output connected to a pump input. This configuration is not supported. For more information see Factoriopedia or the modpage.
